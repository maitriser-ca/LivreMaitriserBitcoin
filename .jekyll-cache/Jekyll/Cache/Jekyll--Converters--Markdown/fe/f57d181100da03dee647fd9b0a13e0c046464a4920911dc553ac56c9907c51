I"ˆ<p>I started translating the magnificent book <em>Mastering Bitcoin, 2nd Open Edition</em> by Andreas M. Antonopoulos at the end of February 2022. The task is relatively simple as most of the tasks are automated through the computer-assisted translation platformâ€“transifex.com (via Google Translate API I think).</p>

<p>The evolving project can be followed at <a href="https://bitcoin.maitriser.ca">bitcoin.maitriser.ca</a>.</p>

<p>I read the book last year through Oâ€™Reilly Online and understood the whole thing (of course!), so when I saw the book wasnâ€™t translated in French (fr_CA), I jumped right in.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was to have a look at some other French locale versions that were in the process of being translated.</p>

<p>French (fr_FR) wasnâ€™t started, and French (fr)â€“as a more generalistic Frenchâ€“was already half done, but to my mind, the text blocks I had read from it were not accessible to my locale, sounding too European. So a request for the French (fr_CA) translation had been answered but poorly started.</p>

<p>My locale is fr_CA, but Iâ€™m not an ace in French writing. French is more complicated than Englishâ€“my second languageâ€“and Iâ€™m not at my best writing French vs writing English which I find easier (due to some professional habitude as Iâ€™ve read mostly in English the last 25 years).</p>

<p>If it werenâ€™t for the help of the translation API, I wouldnâ€™t have started this project, but letâ€™s face itâ€“the translator profession is counting its last days. Letâ€™s say Transifex uses the Google Translate API. The sensible AI behind the whole service is quite capable to giveback. With at least 95% accuracy (from my experience through the project with the translation of plain English text to French (fr_CA)) accurately, the sentences are well translated most of the time.</p>

<p>The only downside from the whole Transifex experience was their inability to apply Glossary terms automatically to the translated text, as the Glossary is a local platform implementation on which the locale terms are suggested instead of applied directly on the API translated text. It would have sped the whole thing a bitâ€¦</p>
